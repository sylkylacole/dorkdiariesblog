# Dork Diaries Blog
I am starting my February project early! I am recreating Nikki's juicy blog and potentially expanding it to make it a full website! For now, I want to get the landing page done :)
Dork Diaries is my childhood favorite book and now, being 20 (almost 21) with an extensive coding background, I want to recreate it as I read the books again!
If you guys want to see any further improvements or additions, feel free to contact me on Discord @quacksssi !!
